## Prediction of the presence of Secretory Signal Peptides in proteins: comparison between three methods

Abstract Predicting secretory signal peptides (SPs) is essential for understanding protein function and subcellular localization, with significant implications in biology and medicine. Traditional experimental methods are accurate but time-intensive, driving the adoption of computational approaches. SPs, located at the Nterminal region, were intensively studied and they are challenging to predict due to their similarity to transmembrane helices. A long history of methods is present in the state of the art, starting from matrixbased approaches, passing through the feature-based approaches and HMMs, finishing to the neural networks (NN) and deep learning (DP) approaches. This study compares three SP classifier methods: a statistical motif-based approach, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) using sequence embeddings as input. Results show that machine learning methods perform much better than the statistical approach; in particular, MLP achieves the best performance and lowest error rates, demonstrating its utility for SP detection.
